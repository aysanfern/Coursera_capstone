    "I am going to assume the position of a business man who wants to either open up a cafe in London. In London there are a lot of areas which are saturated with coffee shops. To ensure I have the best chances of succeeding I would like to open a cafe in an area where cafe's are one of the least (or atleast less) cafe dense areas. \n",

    "The data I will be using will be sourced from Wikipedia inititally for the post codes in United Kingdom. I will then source the areas that are in London. This will then be connecting with the fourspace API to explore nearby venues in each region. I will leave other venues to be included in each region as I want to be able to cluster areas that have a number of venues as well as coffee shops; e.g not just cluster based on the number of coffee shops. I hope to find a cluster of points formed for areas which there are lots of other venues but cafe's are one of the least popular venues.\n"
